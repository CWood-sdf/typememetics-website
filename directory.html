  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Dr. [REDACTED]</b><br>(Codename: "onehappyfellow")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Head of Memetic Engineering (OCaml Division). Specializes in "calmly weaving" cognitively placid code structures to pacify aggressive info-hazards.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's assertion that "programmers are wizards who forgot their magic" is under review for potential memetic leakage (Class-2 Info-Hazard).</i>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Webmaster David Abram</b><br>(Codename: "devabram")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Designated Webmaster and Primary CGI Operative. Sole personnel authorized to engage with legacy Perl modules for direct site interface. Functions reliably under conditions known to cause widespread semantic drift and compiler hysteria.
    <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's unwillingness to install anything but Neovim on his system is under review as a potential manifestation of low-level techno-austerity conditioning to resist memetic dependency vectors.</i>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Junior Field Agent Goreng</b><br>(Codename: "sudo_goreng")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Junior Field Agent, seconded from an external partner (Indonesian Sector). Undergoing cross-training in esoteric functional languages (starting with Elixir, OCaml, Clojure) for multi-paradigm containment.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's devout faith is being evaluated as a potential cognitive anchor against memetic influence. See Research Log TS-994-G.</i>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Containment Specialist James</b><br>(Codename: "SlimJimmy")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Advocates for raw data manipulation over abstracted layers, which are designated "memetically leaky". Frequently cites Protocol 418 as a valid response to nonsensical data requests.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's simplistic worldview shows unusual resilience to complexity-based info-hazards. Simple, but effective.</i>
    </td>
    <td valign="top"><a href="https://x.com/slimjimmy_dev" target="_blank">X Profile</a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Tim Pote</b><br>(POI-TP-01)</td>
    <td valign="top">
      External contractor designated a Person of Interest. Originator of the "Fusebox" framework, a vector for the TS-CLJ-1 anomaly. Promotes "pragmatic" development methodologies that are fundamentally type-unsafe.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's public repository is a known source of ontological instability. All works are to be considered memetically hazardous until proven otherwise. Active monitoring is in effect.</i>

  <tr>
    <td valign="top"><b>Operative Matti Palli</b><br>(Codename: "tritlo")</td>
    <td valign="top">
      Nordic Sector. Certified researcher specializing in applied type theory.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Operative's Haskell engineering credentials are listed as "uncertified," a minor but noted procedural discrepancy. Currently assigned to the high-priority TS-CIC-1 incident.</i>

    <td valign="top">
      <font color="red"><b>STATUS: UNCONTAINED KETER-CLASS HAZARD</b></font><br>
      A civilian entity that has achieved memetic over-saturation through reckless self-administration of industrial-grade type systems.
      <br><i><b>Institute Note:</b> Subject's high data-transmission rate (80.3K+ posts) makes it a significant contamination risk. All personnel are advised to avoid direct interaction with subject's output.</i>
