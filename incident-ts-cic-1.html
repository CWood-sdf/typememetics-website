<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-CIC-1 is a cognitohazard infection embodied by the entity known as alcuin. The subject has developed a paradoxical immunity to standard-issue memetic treatments through chronic, high-dose overexposure. Subject claims to "insufflate 1000mg of CIC daily," referring to the Calculus of Inductive Constructions, a substance far exceeding the potency of therapeutic-grade lambda calculi.
</p>
<p>
This has resulted in a state of "memetic tolerance," rendering conventional cures like STLC and System F ineffective. The subject's cognitive framework is now so saturated with advanced type theory that it has become a novel vector for a highly-resistant info-hazard. The subject's high rate of public data transmission (80.3K+ posts) poses a significant risk of contaminating other systems with this hardened, paradoxical logic.
</p>
<hr>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
Initial advisories recommending therapeutic doses of lambda calculus (STLC, System F, System FÏ‰) have failed. Containment has been escalated. Operative Palli, a researcher with a background in applied Haskell (certification pending review), has been dispatched to administer a direct application of GHC Core with heavy coercions, attempting to force a type-state reset.
</p>
<p>
            A mandatory 3-day cognitive detox protocol, consisting of supervised coding in StandardML, was prescribed to flush the subject's system of the CIC contaminants. This protocol failed when the subject attempted to substitute YAML, citing a shared ".ml" suffix. This indicates a severe breakdown in the subject's ability to parse fundamental type distinctions, confusing structured data with a programming language. The incident has been elevated to the <b>Type System Emergency Council</b> for review.

<b><u>Incident Log: 8-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>10:50:00</b> - Subject alcuin is flagged by ARGUS daemon after public posts
         exhibit a logic pattern resistant to standard memetic analysis.
<b>10:57:00</b> - Subject claims to be self-administering weaponized doses of CIC.
         Standard lambda calculus treatments are administered remotely;
         subject shows no response.
<b>11:34:00</b> - Anomaly is classified as Keter-class. Operative Patti is
         dispatched from the Nordic sector to attempt advanced containment.
<b>12:10:00</b> - Operative Patti prescribes the StandardML detox protocol. Subject responds
         with a data file containing YAML, expressing confusion. The attempt
         is aborted due to risk of catastrophic type error.
<b>13:25:00</b> - Containment is re-evaluated. The subject's high dissemination rate
         and resistance to both simple and advanced treatments necessitate
         escalation. A formal request is sent to the Type System Emergency
         Council to consider more... permanent solutions.
