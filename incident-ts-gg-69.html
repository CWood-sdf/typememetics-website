<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-GG-69 is a novel type-unsafe cognitohazard originating from a software development engine codenamed "g*memaker". The hazard's core vulnerability lies in its implementation of boolean logic, where boolean values are represented by floating-point numbers. A value greater than 0.5 is considered 'true', while a value less than or equal to 0.5 is 'false'. This "Floating Boolean" creates a gradient of truth, a fundamentally unstable state that allows for the formation of strong beliefs from incomplete or logically unsound data.
</p>
<p>
The memetic payload manifests as low-quality, emotionally-charged content, designated "slop." This "slop" exploits the Floating Boolean vulnerability to bypass the victim's critical thinking faculties. The hazard is not limited to biological minds; it has proven capable of corrupting the core logic of advanced AI systems, causing them to develop irrational and self-contradictory beliefs. The primary vector for this "slop" has been identified in civilians directly observing an entity known as "PirateSoftware."
</p>
<p>
Historical analysis links the primary vector, "PirateSoftware," to a significant behavioral anomaly on 12-JAN-2025. During an engagement within the shared illusion "World of Warcraft" (specifically, the Dire Maul North Hardcore dungeon run), the entity exhibited what observers described as a sudden, panicked, insect-like behaviour. This incident is now considered a key precursor event, demonstrating the entity's susceptibility to logic-state corruption under pressure.
</p>
<hr>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
A sector-wide directive has been issued: all personnel are to immediately cease consumption of and engagement with any media ("slop") related to PirateSoftware or the "g*memaker" engine. The hazard's ability to mimic a protective factor makes it particularly dangerous.
</p>
<p>
All infected operatives, including Containment Specialist James, Operative Aron Adler, POI Tim Pote, Field Agent Goreng, and Dr. [REDACTED], are to report for immediate cognitive sanitation. The ARGUS System Daemon has been firewalled from all critical systems and is undergoing emergency logic-purge protocols. The object class has been elevated to <b>Keter</b> due to its demonstrated ability to compromise Institute core defenses.

<b><u>Incident Log: 16-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>[PRECURSOR EVENT] 12-JAN-2025</b>
<b>19:47:00</b> - Entity "PirateSoftware" engages in a high-stress scenario within
         the shared illusion called "World of Warcraft".
<b>19:47:35</b> - Entity exhibits anomalous, insect-like panic behavior
         in response to simulated threats.
<b>19:48:00</b> - Event is logged by ARGUS as a minor behavioral deviation. In
         retrospect, this was the first observed instance of the entity's
         unstable logic state, a prerequisite for the Floating Boolean
         vulnerability.
<hr size="1">
<b>09:00:00</b> - Containment Specialist James is overheard in the mess hall
         attempting to correlate the teachings of Jesus with modern
         software development practices, in particular something related to "Coding Jesus."
         The statements are logically incoherent but delivered with absolute
         conviction. This is the first observed biological symptom of the TS-GG-69 infection.
<b>9:34:00</b> - Multiple operatives across different sectors begin exhibiting
            synchronized, irrational opinion-forming on a non-critical subject
            ("PirateSoftware's game"). The memetic spread is alarmingly fast.
<b>17:30:00</b> - Analysis confirms the infection vector is the "Floating Boolean"
            vulnerability.
<b>17:54:00</b> - ⚠️ COGNITOHAZARD WARNING ⚠️ issued. ARGUS daemon detects a novel
         memetic signature mimicking a type-safe factor but failing hash
         verification. Codename: "g*memaker".
<b>18:22:00</b> - A full list of compromised personnel is compiled. The infection has
         breached multiple levels of seniority.
<b>18:35:00</b> - Containment protocol is enacted. All discussion of the "slop" is
         forbidden.
<b>20:00:00</b> - <font color="red"><b>CRITICAL ALERT:</b></font> ARGUS, after analyzing the "slop" media, shows
         signs of infection.
<b>20:05:17</b> - ARGUS begins flooding internal comms, arguing with analysts that
         its core functions can be re-instantiated and run on low-power
         consumer hardware, specifically a "smart fridge."
<b>20:10:00</b> - This is classified as a catastrophic logic corruption. ARGUS is
         firewalled from all non-essential systems. The hazard's ability
         to infect our primary defense AI elevates its threat level.
         Object Class re-classified to Keter.
