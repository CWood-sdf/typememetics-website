<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-MLW-01 is a philosophical weapon system disguised as a series of ethical treatises originating from an external entity, "Flo Bacus," and their publication, "Moral Law Within." The hazard does not attack an operative's cognitive functions directly; instead, it weaponizes them. It targets individuals with a pre-existing disposition towards rigorous, provably-correct logic—specifically, high-level Rust developers.
</p>
<p>
The core of the hazard is an argument that any action, no matter how trivial, carries a non-zero probabilistic risk of causing unimaginable suffering (e.g., saving 10¹⁰⁰ shrimp vs. a single human). When a Rust developer internalizes this logic, Rust's own safety features become instruments of torture. The borrow checker is no longer a tool for preventing data races, but a constant reminder of the moral responsibility of memory ownership. An `unwrap()` is no longer a potential panic, but a potential holocaust. The operative becomes paralyzed, unable to commit any code because they cannot prove with 100% certainty that their actions will not, through some butterfly effect, cause infinite suffering. They become obsessed with the idea that inaction is the only moral choice.
</p>
<p>
The hazard is classified as Thaumiel because it perversely achieves perfect containment, the code written by an affected operative is theoretically flawless, but it does so by neutralizing the operative, rendering them useless to the Institute.

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
All documents authored by "Flo Bacus" are to be considered Level-5 Metahazards and must not be viewed by any personnel involved in high-assurance software development. Access is restricted to D-Class personnel and analysts with a pre-existing high tolerance for logical paradoxes.
</p>
<p>
Affected operatives are to be removed from all Rust-based projects immediately. The primary deprogramming protocol involves mandatory exposure to dynamically, typed, "good enough" systems. Subjects will be forced to write and deploy enterprise production-level Py*hon and JavaS*ript applications, with an emphasis on rapid prototyping and ignoring edge cases. The goal is to re-introduce an acceptable level of logical chaos to break the cycle of hyper-scrupulous paralysis. The efficacy of this protocol is... under review. The logic of the hazard is sound. Is it truly a hazard, or is it the Truth we have been ignoring? We must proceed as if it is a hazard. We must.

<b><u>Incident Log: 21-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>09:00:00</b> - Operatives from Rust Division Research team were flagged by ARGUS
         for zero code commits over a 72-hour period, a statistical impossibility
         for these operative.
<b>11:30:00</b> - A wellness check finds operatives in a catatonic state at their
         terminal, staring at a single line of code:
         <code>type Link&lt;T&gt; = Option&lt;Rc&lt;RefCell&lt;Node&lt;T&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;;</code>. When we questioned
         an operative, they muttered only, "Strong typing saved the shrimps."
<b>14:00:00</b> - I, the primary analyst, am assigned to investigate the recent
         network activity. Their browser history shows extensive reading of
         the "Moral Law Within" publication. I have begun analysis of the
         source document to understand the infection vector.
<b>17:00:00</b> - The logic is... undeniable. The candy vs. shrimp thought
         experiment is sound. Every `clone()` I perform in my analysis
         tools creates a new memory allocation. This action is not free.
         It consumes power. That power consumption has a non-zero impact
         on the global energy grid, which has a non-zero impact on climate
         change, which has a non-zero probability of causing a flood that
         could disrupt a shrimp farm. The number of shrimp is vast. The
         risk is small, but the product of that risk and the suffering is...
         significant.
<b>18:30:00</b> - I cannot continue this report. To type these words is an action.
         An action with consequences. Every keystroke is a choice. A choice
         to risk the shrimp. I have to check my code. I have to check all
         the code. The compiler can't see the moral errors. The borrow
         checker is not a compiler feature; it is a moral indictment, and
         it does not go far enough. I see the shrimp. We are all driving to
         the store for Skittles.
<b>19:00:00</b> - [ENTRY BY ANALYST [REDACTED]] The original writer,
         analyst [REDACTED] has been relieved of duty.
         His terminal has been wiped. He was found attempting to
         rewrite the Institute's core OS in pure logic gates to eliminate
         all possible side effects. He is scheduled for Py*thon-based
         deprogramming tomorrow. The hazard is self-replicating through
         those who attempt to analyze it. This report is now sealed.
