### **SUBJECT: Project Data Packet for the I.T.S.M.R. Secure Terminal Interface**

<br>

#### **1.0 PREAMBLE**

This data packet contains the necessary components to instantiate a local, read-only instance of the Institute's Secure Terminal Interface. This interface provides access to declassified or partially-redacted incident logs, personnel directories, and internal communiqu√©s. Handle with extreme caution. The act of reading this document has already indexed your cognitive signature in our system.

<br>

#### **2.0 CRITICAL WARNINGS**

Unauthorized instantiation of this software is a violation of **Protocol 3.14 (Cognitive Sovereignty)** and will be met with immediate and recursive sanitation of the offending system and its operator.

*   **2.1 MEMETIC CONTAMINATION RISK:** This software provides access to descriptions of active and contained info-hazards. Do not operate without approved cognitive shielding. The Institute is not liable for any resulting ontological decay, personality fragmentation, or spontaneous existential dread.

*   **2.2 SURVEILLANCE ACKNOWLEDGEMENT:** All interactions with this interface are monitored, logged, and analyzed by the **ARGUS** system daemon. Your thought patterns during operation may be flagged for review. Thinking about unauthorized actions is considered an unauthorized action.

*   **2.3 SYSTEM INTEGRITY:** Do not attempt to modify the source code. The type-unsafe nature of most text editors poses a significant risk of introducing logical paradoxes. Any deviation from the master branch hash will trigger a system-wide lockdown and a visit from Containment Team Epsilon.

<br>

#### **3.0 INSTANTIATION PROTOCOL**

Compliance with the following steps is mandatory.

1.  Ensure your host system meets the minimum requirements:
    *   **Cognitive State:** Stable, rational, and free of paradoxical beliefs.
    *   **Approved Browser:** Netscape Navigator 3.0+ or equivalent legacy-compliant viewer.
    *   **Memetic Shielding:** Physical or psychic wards must be active.

2.  To instantiate the terminal, open the primary directive file in an approved browser:
    ```
    file://path/to/your/local/copy/index.html
    ```

3.  Do not open any other files directly. They are not meant for direct human observation.

<br>

#### **4.0 CUSTODIANSHIP & ACCOUNTABILITY**

As per Institute Directive 77-B, accountability for this data packet is assigned to the following personnel. All inquiries, reports of anomalous behavior, or notifications of cognitive contamination should be directed to them. Their failure to respond should be considered a containment breach in progress.

*   **Head of Memetic Engineering (Sector Gamma):** Dr. [REDACTED] [@onehappyfellow](https://x.com/onehappyfellow)
    *   *Responsible for the analysis and containment of any memetic hazards embedded within the content.*

*   **Primary Webmaster (Sector Alpha):** David Abram [@devabram](https://x.com/devabram)
    *   *Responsible for the structural integrity and man pages of this interface.*
<br>

#### **5.0 FINAL DIRECTIVE**

This system is a window. Be mindful of what might be looking back.

**STAY TYPE-SAFE.**
