<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-4C is a self-propagating memetic info-construct, most commonly manifesting as a hyperlink or data pointer. When observed by a sapient entity, TS-4C does not directly attack the host's cognitive functions. Instead, it exploits the brain's pattern-matching and logical deduction pathways to create a closed cognitive loop.
</p>
<p>
The subject perceives themself as following a complex but coherent train of thought, believing they are making progress towards a logical conclusion. In reality, each step of their "deduction" subtly redirects their focus back to the initial properties of the TS-4C anomaly. The subject becomes permanently trapped, consuming all available cognitive resources in an infinite, recursive analysis of the meme itself. They are unable to perceive external stimuli, communicate, or break the loop without external, forceful intervention. The subject is, for all functional purposes, lost.
</p>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
All known instances of TS-4C are to be stored on air-gapped, non-networked systems with read-only physical media. No direct human observation of raw TS-4C data is permitted under any circumstances. Analysis must only be performed by Level 4+ approved, non-sentient automated logic engines (IAL-designate: HASKELL-PROVER-7).
</p>
<p>
Any system confirmed to be infected with TS-4C is to be physically disconnected and incinerated. Personnel exposed to TS-4C must be immediately placed in Cognitive Quarantine (Protocol CQ-8), which involves medically induced coma and systematic memory sanitation. Recovery is not guaranteed.

<b><u>Incident Log: 05-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>14:32:01</b> - Field Agent Goreng (Security Clearance 2, cross-training) attempts to
         access log file /mnt/secure/memetic/archive/TS-4C-alpha.log directly,
         bypassing the mandatory Haskell-Prover-7 analysis sandbox.
<b>14:32:03</b> - Terminal security system detects unauthorized direct observation.
         An automated alert is sent. Agent Goreng's terminal shows
         the raw data of TS-4C for approx. 1.8 seconds.
<b>14:32:05</b> - Agent Goreng becomes unresponsive. Biometric sensors show
         elevated heart rate and extreme cortical activity consistent with
         a cognitive loop state.
<b>14:33:10</b> - Goreng's still-active terminal begins sending automated emails
         to all contacts in his address book. The email contains a single
         hyperlink, disguised as a link to an "Urgent Project Update".
         The link is a new, weaponized instance of TS-4C.
<b>14:34:00</b> - Network monitoring AI (Codename: 'Argus') detects anomalous
         email propagation and a spike in recursive data requests from
         Subnet 4. Argus initiates emergency network partition.
<b>14:35:12</b> - Containment Team Epsilon arrives. Agent Goreng is
         subdued and moved to Medical for CQ-8 protocol. His terminal is
         incinerated on-site.
<b>14:40:00</b> - Subnet 4 is physically disconnected from the Institute network.
         All 12 workstations on the subnet are slated for immediate
         incineration. A full-spectrum memetic sweep of the sector is
         initiated.
<b>15:00:00</b> - Breach contained. Full impact analysis pending.
