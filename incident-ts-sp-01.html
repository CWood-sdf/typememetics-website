<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-SP-01 is a human entity, designated Soham Parekh, capable of violating the Axiom of Singular Employment. The anomaly manifests as an ability to exist in a state of "ontological duplicity," presenting itself as a unique, full-time operative to multiple, independent organizations simultaneously.
</p>
<p>
The entity exhibits a high degree of "interface mimicry," successfully passing complex vetting and interview protocols at numerous tech firms, including several Institute-opposed companies. However, its underlying implementation is flawed. While appearing valid to each system in isolation, its divided state results in critical resource contention, logical paradoxes (e.g., conflicting stand-up reports), and a near-total failure to produce deliverables. The anomaly's resume has been found to contain numerous corrupted data pointers and instances of referential decay (dead links), suggesting its very history is state-inconsistent.
</p>
<hr>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
Direct interaction with TS-SP-01 is forbidden. The entity is considered a conceptual hazard that can infect organizational structures with the belief that polymorphic employment is a viable state. All hiring protocols must now include a mandatory "State Singularity Verification" to ensure potential operatives are not instantiated elsewhere in the global namespace.
</p>
<p>
Any organization found to have been infiltrated by TS-SP-01 must undergo a full system audit to check for logical corruption and paradoxes introduced by the anomaly's presence. Attempts by external parties to "talk sense" into the entity have failed, proving it is resistant to simple cognitive realignment.

<b><u>Incident Log: 03-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>09:00:00</b> - Anomaly first flagged by Analyst-Delta-5 after observing identical,
         paradoxical resource drains across multiple, otherwise unrelated
         AI startups.
<b>10:45:00</b> - Cross-referencing of personnel manifests reveals a single entity,
         Soham Parekh, is the common variable. The entity appears to be
         holding full-time roles at 4+ organizations concurrently.
<b>11:30:00</b> - [REDACTED], an allied researcher at [REDACTED], confirms prior
         interaction. He had instantiated a local instance of TS-SP-01,
         detected the state violation within one week, and attempted a
         "manual de-bugging" before terminating the process. The attempt
         to enforce a singular state failed.
<b>13:00:00</b> - The anomaly is officially designated TS-SP-01. Its methodology is
         classified as a direct attack on the conceptual integrity of
         employment and identity.
<b>15:20:00</b> - A sector-wide alert is issued to all companies,
         warning them of the polymorphic operative. All systems are advised
         to update their hiring protocols to prevent further infiltration.
