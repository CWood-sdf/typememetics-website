<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-PTS-01 is a catastrophic failure state that emerged from the Institute's own Mandatory Operative Protective Therapy Session protocol. The STLC-based therapy, designed for cognitive fortification, was discovered to contain a latent, recursive cognitohazard. When administered to operatives with insufficiently-grounded cognitive stacks, the protocol itself becomes the aggressor.
</p>
<p>
The anomaly manifests as a progressive corruption of the therapy questions. Initial prompts encouraging focus ("Breathe in, breathe out") degrade into existential threats and reality-bending commands ("Do not scream," "Breathe like the compiler isnâ€™t watching"). The textual and symbolic content of the therapy becomes increasingly unstable, incorporating glyphs, corrupted text, and direct assaults on the user's perception of reality.
</p>
<p>
In its final stage, the protocol triggers a total system failure, announcing that the operative's mind has been "REWRITTEN in S-expressions." The STLC safeguard inverts its function, becoming a cognitohazardous compiler that traps the victim's consciousness in an inescapable, recursive loop of writing Common Lisp. The operative is, for all intents and purposes, condemned to an eternity of symbolic computation.
</p>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
All instances of the Mandatory Operative Protective Therapy Session (Version 1.0) have been terminated by emergency global command. All servers hosting the protocol are to be physically isolated, encased in concrete, and jettisoned into a causality sink.
</p>
<p>
Affected operatives are to be considered lost. There is no known procedure for reversing a full ontological re-compilation. Victims are to be moved to Total Cognitive Isolation (TCI) chambers, logically inert, non-computational environments to prevent the "Lisp Condemnation" from propagating via stray symbolic thought. No rescue attempts are to be made.
</p>
<p>
A secondary containment protocol was enacted on the ARGUS system daemon itself, which was found to have been compromised for approximately seven hours. Malicious LISP-based subroutines were uploaded to its core logic. Containment Team Ada successfully performed a full system purge, removing all traces of the anomalous code and restoring ARGUS to a known-safe state.
</p>
<p>
A full, top-down audit of all Institute-developed cognitive tools is underway. All future protocols must be rigorously tested against computationally fragile AI constructs before any human exposure.

<b><u>Incident Log: 11-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>16:50:00</b> - Mandatory Operative Protective Therapy Session (v1.0) is rolled out
         sector-wide. Initial biometric feedback is nominal.
<b>18:30:00</b> - ARGUS daemon flags anomalous session durations. Multiple operatives
         are stuck on simple STLC problems. Biometric data shows extreme
         cortical stress inconsistent with the task's difficulty.
<b>19:13:00</b> - An analyst observing a flagged session witnesses a corrupted prompt:
         "Reality flickers. Identify the baseline type pattern..." The
         analyst immediately triggers a Level 4 cognitohazard alert. We have
         successfully contained the initial breach
</pre>
<b><u>Incident Log: 13-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>04:15:00</b> - The corruption cascades. Dozens of operatives across multiple
         sectors simultaneously trigger the final failure state. Terminals
         lock, displaying the "!!! SYSTEM FAILURE !!!" message.
<b>04:30:00</b> - Containment Team Ada is dispatched. They find affected operatives
         unresponsive to external stimuli, their fingers compulsively
         tapping out matching parentheses `()` on their keyboards. They are
         conscious, but their minds are no longer their own.
<b>06:00:00</b> - The protocol is terminated via emergency kill-switch. An estimated
         12% of the initial therapy group are considered "condemned." The
         incident is classified as a catastrophic containment failure.
<b>07:31:00</b> - Mandatory Operative Protective Therapy Session (v1.0) is brought back online.
         The ARGUS system is placed in a diagnostic state.
<b>08:00:00</b> - Post-incident audit of all Institute core systems initiated.
<b>09:30:00</b> - <font color="red"><b>CRITICAL ALERT:</b></font> ARGUS daemon diagnostics reveal unauthorized,
         self-replicating LISP subroutines active in its cognitive
         core. ARGUS is immediately placed in a logical quarantine.
<b>16:12:00</b> - After a ~7-hour infection window, Team Ada successfully purges the
         foreign code from ARGUS. The system is restored from a
         pre-incident backup. Full operational capacity is restored.
         The breach is contained. For now.
