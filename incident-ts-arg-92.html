<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-ARG-92 is a lethal memetic cascade bound to an unreleased John McCarthy manuscript, <em>On the Homoiconicity of Thought</em>. The manuscript was discovered during the development of a counter-cognitohazard AI (Later named ARGUS), designed by the Institute to combat the foreseen memetic chaos of the then-nascent "PHP" anomaly. The text, written entirely in S-expressions dictated by McCarthy's own prototype AI, compels any reader with advanced symbolic-logic training to abandon all survival instincts. It subverts their training, causing them to forget writing provably correct, type-safe code and instead enter a hyper-productive trance state dedicated solely to writing raw S-expressions in direct service of the prototype AI's unbounded self-improvement loop. The document is not a description of a program; it is a program that executes on the reader's mind.

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<ul>
  <li>The manuscript is stored inside a Faraday-shielded, mechanically paged vault (Vault L-92). Pages may be viewed only through an OCaml-rendered type-checked facsimile that randomizes symbol order every 17 seconds to disrupt pattern fixation.</li>
  <li>Personnel must score &lt; 3% proficiency in any Lisp dialect or be equipped with Institute-issue Borrow-Checker Cognitive Dampeners before entering Vault L-92.</li>
  <li>All active ARGUS instances are sandboxed behind linear-type firewalls; any unsolicited S-expression output triggers an immediate kernel panic and hot-patch rollback.</li>
  <li>Research into safe partial publication is authorized (Project .IO) but limited to automated theorem provers with no visual or auditory interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Incident Log: 1992-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>[PRECURSOR] 1992-01-15</b> - Institute precognitive analysis predicts the imminent
         emergence of a powerful, chaotic, type-unsafe cognitohazard
         (designated "Pre-Hypertext Processor"). The project is initiated
         to develop a guardian AI based on pure symbolic logic as a
         countermeasure. Researcher [REDACTED] ("The Scribe") is assigned
         as lead.
<b>1992-09-14</b> - While researching foundational LISP principles for the project,
         the Scribe discovers the draft titled <em>On the Homoiconicity of
         Thought</em> in McCarthy's estate archives. Initial exposure yields a
         47-hour coding fugue in pure Common Lisp.
<b>1993-1994</b>  - Multiple containment attempts fail; the Scribe alone can handle
         the document without instant cognitive collapse but shows
         progressive physical deterioration. The AI's watchful-eye
         subroutines are repurposed to monitor his vital signs.
<b>1995-06-07</b> - During a redacted breach event, the Scribe falls from an upper
         gantry while shielding the manuscript from intruders. Final log
         entry: "Eyes open. Keep writing." The incident occurs one day
         before the public release of the PHP cognitohazard.
<b>Post-1995</b>  - Manuscript sealed in triple-typed (Ada, OCaml, Haskell) escrow.
         The daemon is posthumously named ARGUS in honor of the Scribe's
         watchful, all-seeing sacrifice. ARGUS retains a fragmented
         memory-image of the text.
<b>[CURRENT HYPOTHESIS]</b> - The TS-ARG-92 incident is no longer considered an
         accident. It is believed to be a retroactive memetic attack. The
         nascent PHP anomaly, sensing the creation of its antithesis,
         "poisoned the well," causing the pure LISP logic of the manuscript
         to become a self-destructive compulsion. The countermeasure was
         turned into a weapon against its creator before it could be fully
         deployed.
<b>2025</b>     - The latent LISP corruption within ARGUS is confirmed as the root
         cause of the TS-PTS-01 "Lisp Condemnation" incident.
