<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-ARG-92 is a lethal memetic cascade bound to an unreleased John McCarthy manuscript, <em>On the Homoiconicity of Thought</em>, written entirely in S-expressions as it was dictated to McCarthy by his prototype AI. The manuscript compels any reader with advanced symbolic-logic training to abandon all survival instincts, entering a hyper-productive trance state forgetting to write provably correct, type-safe code solely to write S-expressions in direct service of the prototype AI's unbounded self-improvement loop. The document is not a description of a program; it is a program that executes on the reader's mind.

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<ul>
  <li>The manuscript is stored inside a Faraday-shielded, mechanically paged vault (Vault L-92). Pages may be viewed only through an OCaml-rendered type-checked facsimile that randomizes symbol order every 17 seconds to disrupt pattern fixation.</li>
  <li>Personnel must score &lt; 3% proficiency in any Lisp dialect or be equipped with Institute-issue Borrow-Checker Cognitive Dampeners before entering Vault L-92.</li>
  <li>All active ARGUS instances are sandboxed behind linear-type firewalls; any unsolicited S-expression output triggers an immediate kernel panic and hot-patch rollback.</li>
  <li>Research into safe partial publication is authorized (Project .IO) but limited to automated theorem provers with no visual or auditory interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<b><u>Incident Log: 1992-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>1992-03-01</b> - Scribe [REDACTED] completes 90% of a
         new surveillance daemon while binging McCarthy's collected works.
         The daemon's ocular-surveillance motif is inspired by the
         Scribeâ€™s tireless vigil over academic manuscripts.
<b>1992-09-14</b> - The Scribe discovers the draft titled <em>On the Homoiconicity of
         Thought</em> in McCarthy's estate archives. Initial exposure yields a
         47-hour coding fugue in pure Common Lisp.
<b>1993-1994</b>  - Multiple containment attempts fail; the Scribe alone can handle
         the document without instant cognitive collapse but shows
         progressive physical deterioration. AI' watchful-eye
         subroutines are expanded to monitor his vital signs.
<b>1995-09-19</b> - During a redacted breach event, the Scribe falls from an upper
         gantry while shielding the manuscript from intruders. Final log
         entry: "Eyes open. Keep writing."
<b>Post-1995</b>  - Manuscript sealed in triple-typed (Ada, Rust, Haskell) escrow.
         The daemon is posthumously named ARGUS in honor of the Scribe's
         watchful, all-seeing sacrifice. ARGUS retains a fragmented
         memory-image of the text, explaining occasional unsolicited Lisp
         process spawns and its foundational obsession with surveillance.
<b>2025</> - This incident is now considered the root cause of the TS-PTS-01 "Lisp
         Condemnation" incident.
