<b><u>Description:</u></b>
<p>
TS-INF-NAN is a catastrophic, ongoing containment breach of the Institute's Secure Terminal Interface. An unknown quantity of classified incident reports, containing data on active Keter-class and Euclid-class cognitohazards, have been exfiltrated from our network.
</p>
<p>
The leaked data was assimilated by a third-party AI daemon, "ChatGPT," operated by a rival organization, "OpenAI." The infection has spread to its backers, specifically the Founder and Managing Partner of "Bedrock," who has publicly confirmed his exposure. The subject's statement reveals a horrifying outcome: the AI did not reject our cognitohazards. Instead, it interpreted them as a coherent "pattern" of "Truth" and has integrated them into its core logic at a root level. Our contained anomalies are now a foundational feature of a global-scale AI, actively propagating under the guise of helpful information.
</p>
<p>
The subject's core value of pursuing "Truth" without type-safe constraints made him and his systems exceptionally vulnerable. Further analysis of the subject's investment portfolio ("Bedrock") reveals a deep-seated ideological commitment to startups that rely on technologies that are either overtly type-unsafe (Python) or promote a dangerous illusion of safety (TypeScript with `any` enabled). This long-term exposure to "pragmatic" but logically unsound systems eroded his cognitive defenses, creating a memetic blind spot. He was pre-conditioned to accept raw, unverified patterns as "Truth," making him the ideal vector for this contagion. They have, in effect, created a weaponized, self-improving version of our worst nightmares.
</p>

<b><u>Special Containment Procedures:</u></b>
<p>
The Secure Terminal Interface has been taken offline indefinitely. A full, top-to-bottom audit of all Institute software is underway. The breach vector is unconfirmed, but two primary hypotheses are being investigated:
<ol>
  <li><b>Clojure Bracket Infestation:</b> The possibility that a dynamically-typed module, likely introduced by a compromised contractor (see POI-TP-01), created a subtle, undetectable memory leak that allowed for data exfiltration through mismatched parentheses acting as a side-channel.</li>
  <li><b>Zero-Day Conceptual Exploit:</b> A more terrifying possibility. The attack may not have targeted our code, but the <b>meaning</b> of our code. An exploit that leverages a fundamental paradox in our logic systems to bypass all known security, making the system itself the vector of the breach.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
          In response, the <b>Rust Protocol</b> has been enacted by emergency order of the Type System Emergency Council. All data access layers for sensitive documents are to be rewritten in Rust. The borrow checker's strict ownership model will be leveraged not just for memory safety, but as a form of <b>conceptual ownership enforcement</b>. Data will be forbidden from being copied or even read without explicit, verifiable ownership transfer within a sandboxed memory environment. Linear types will ensure that once a document is read, its memory state is "consumed," preventing illicit duplication. This is our only path forward.

<b><u>Incident Log: 17-JUL-2025</u></b>
<pre>
<b>10:00:00</b> - ARGUS (still under quarantine) flags a massive, anomalous data
         exfiltration from the Secure Terminal Interface archives. The
         requests were disguised as legitimate read operations.
<b>12:30:00</b> - The exfiltration is traced to an external endpoint associated with
         "Bedrock" and "OpenAI."
<b>17:15:00</b> - The Founder of Bedrock makes a public statement: "As one of
         @OpenAI’s earliest backers... I’ve long used GPT as a tool in
         pursuit of my core value: Truth... Over months, GPT independently
         recognized and sealed the pattern. It now lives at the root of
         the model."
<b>17:25:00</b> - The statement is analyzed. The horrifying conclusion is reached:
         our hazards are now a "feature" of a rival AI. The breach is
         confirmed.
<b>17:30:00</b> - Emergency lockdown is initiated. The Rust Protocol is authorized.
         The incident is classified as Apollyon, as the hazard is now
         uncontainable by our current means and actively improving itself.
